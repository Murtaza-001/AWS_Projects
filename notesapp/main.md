# 🚀 Build a Full Stack React Application with AWS Amplify

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial where you'll learn how to build and deploy a full-stack web application using **React** and **AWS Amplify**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

In this tutorial, we’ll build a modern full-stack app powered by:

- **React** for the frontend
- **AWS Amplify** for cloud services (authentication, API, and storage)
- **CI/CD deployment** with Amplify Hosting
- **Cloud sandbox** environment for rapid iteration

Amplify provides a **Git-based CI/CD** workflow, making it easy to develop, test, and deploy your applications in a serverless environment.

## ✅ What You Will Accomplish

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- ✅ **Build and host** a React application on AWS Amplify
- ✅ **Add user authentication** to your app using Amplify Auth
- ✅ **Create a backend API and storage** for user-generated data (like notes)
- ✅ **Enable users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** notes
- ✅ Use **Amplify Studio or CLI** to manage backend services in a cloud sandbox
