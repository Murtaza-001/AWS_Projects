# Build a Full Stack React Application 

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a simple full-stack web application using AWS Amplify. Amplify offers a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, 
and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with serverless backends.

## What you will accomplish
In this tutorial, you will:

- Build and host a React application on AWS
- Use Amplify to add authentication, data & storage solutions to the app
- Start a cloud sandbox environment that provides an isolated development space to rapidly build, test, and iterate on a fullstack app
- Implement the frontend code to enable users to create, update, and delete notes
