# Serverless Web Application using Generative AI
In this Project you will use AWS Amplify to build a serverless web application powered by Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model. Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the application will generate delicious recipes based on the input ingredients. The application includes an HTML-based user interface for ingredient submission and a backend web app to request AI-generated recipes.

## What you will accomplish
- Configure AWS Amplify to host your frontend application with continuous deployment built in
- Configure Amplify Auth and enable Amazon Bedrock foundation model Access
- Build an app backend for handling requests for your web application
- Use Amplify Data to call the serverless backend
- Connect the app to the backend
