# Serverless Web Application using Generative AI
In this Project you will use AWS Amplify to build a serverless web application powered by Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model. Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the application will generate delicious recipes based on the input ingredients. The application includes an HTML-based user interface for ingredient submission and a backend web app to request AI-generated recipes.
